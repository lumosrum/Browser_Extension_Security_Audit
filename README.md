# 🧩 Browser Extension Security Audit

## 📘 Overview
This project focuses on auditing browser extensions to identify and remove potentially harmful or unnecessary add-ons. It aims to improve browser performance, security, and user privacy.

## 🔍 Steps Performed
1. Opened the browser’s **extension/add-ons manager**.  
2. Reviewed all installed extensions and checked their permissions.  
3. Identified and removed **suspicious or unused extensions**.  
4. Restarted the browser and noted performance improvements.  
5. Researched how **malicious extensions can harm users** through data theft, tracking, and browser hijacking.  
6. Documented all actions and findings in a detailed report.

## ⚠️ Risks of Malicious Extensions
- Steal sensitive information such as passwords and browsing data.  
- Inject unwanted ads or change default search engines.  
- Track user activity or perform hidden crypto mining.
